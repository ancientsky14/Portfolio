/**
 * Tools, in two lists.
 *
 * TOOLS — the stack. Every entry actually appears in a shipped system's
 * `stack` in content/work/*.mdx, or in this repo's own package.json. The
 * About page lists all of it. A buyer who spots one tool you cannot discuss
 * on a call discounts the rest, so it stays short and true.
 *
 * WORKFLOW — what Jan works in every day: editor, AI coding agents,
 * automation. Not part of a shipped stack, so the receipt is Jan's word.
 *
 * MARQUEE — the home page's tools row, chosen by Jan on 2026-09-11: his
 * workflow first, then the stack without the languages and libraries he left
 * off the row (TypeScript, Rust, Vite, PocketBase, GSAP, Three.js), then
 * HOSTING — where he deploys.
 *
 * `where` is not rendered. It is the receipt: why this entry is allowed to
 * be on the list.
