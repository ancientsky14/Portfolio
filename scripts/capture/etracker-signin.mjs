/**
 * eTracker — the production sign-in page, and nothing past it.
 *
 * The one reviewed exception to "local instances only" (scripts/capture/
 * lib.mjs): the live sign-in screen has no records behind it, and it is the
 * page the case study already links to. The script never signs in, never
 * types into a field, and refuses any other origin.
 *
 * The app's inside is captured from a local, synthetic-data stack instead
 * (scripts/capture/etracker.mjs, once Docker is running).
 *
 *   node scripts/capture/etracker-signin.mjs
